                    <p>At <strong><?php echo config('domain_name'); ?></strong>, we’re committed to delivering
                        dependable travel services while recognizing that sometimes travel plans don't go as expected.
                        That’s why we offer a clear and supportive cancellation policy designed with your convenience in
                        mind.</p>

                    <p><strong>Flight Interruptions –</strong><br />
                        Should your flight face delays, schedule changes, or cancellations,
                        <strong><?php echo config('domain_name'); ?></strong> will promptly notify you via email or
                        phone, ensuring you're informed and can adjust plans smoothly.</p>

                    <p><strong>Support for Rebooking –</strong><br />
                        If your trip is disrupted, our customer care team will help with rebooking based on your travel
                        preferences. We're here to ease the process with minimal hassle. Specific airline rules may
                        apply, so we encourage reviewing our full Terms and Conditions for more.</p>

                    <p><strong>Refund Conditions –</strong><br />
                        Some cancellations may qualify for a refund, especially in cases of weather-related or
                        operational disruptions. However, all refund decisions are governed by the airline’s policy.
                        <strong><?php echo config('domain_name'); ?></strong> acts solely as an intermediary and does
                        not control refund approvals or processing times.</p>

                <div class="section">
                    <h2><span class="section-number">Section 2</span> — Refund Guidelines</h2>
                    <p>We aim to make the refund process as transparent and straightforward as possible. If a refund is
                        due, our team will help guide you every step of the way.</p>

                    <p><strong>24-Hour Full Refunds –</strong><br />
                        If you request a cancellation within 24 hours of booking, you may be eligible for a full refund,
                        depending on the airline’s fare rules. Outside this period, cancellation fees may apply, and
                        refund eligibility will depend on the terms set by the airline.</p>

                    <p><strong>Non-Refundable Bookings –</strong><br />
                        Tickets purchased under special fares or promotional offers may not qualify for a refund. We
                        strongly advise reviewing all fare conditions before confirming your booking to avoid surprises.
                    </p>

                    <p><strong>Processing Timeline –</strong><br />
                        After the airline approves a refund, we’ll process it on your behalf. Depending on the airline
                        and your bank, it can take anywhere from 7 to 21 business days for the funds to reflect in your
                        account. Throughout this process, our team will keep you updated.</p>
