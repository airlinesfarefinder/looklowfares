                    <p><strong><?php echo config('domain_name'); ?></strong> offers a wide range of travel services such
                        as flight tickets, hotel bookings, vacation deals, cruises, and more — all accessible through
                        our user-friendly platform. We function independently and serve as a booking agent for
                        third-party travel service providers.</p>

                    <p>All reservations made via <strong><?php echo config('domain_name'); ?></strong> are fulfilled by
                        these external partners. While we work hard to connect you with reputable providers,
                        <strong><?php echo config('domain_name'); ?></strong> is not responsible for the actions,
                        service quality, or fulfillment delays caused by those suppliers. This includes, but is not
                        limited to, missed flights, schedule changes, cancellations, overbookings, damaged or lost
                        belongings, or any other disruptions. Any claims or refunds in such cases must be pursued
                        directly with the respective provider, unless the issue was a direct result of an error on our
                        part.</p>

                    <p><strong>We do not guarantee fares, schedules, seating availability, baggage services, or
                            connection times unless such commitments are specifically listed as “guaranteed” in your
                            booking confirmation, invoice, or itinerary.</strong></p>

                    <p><strong><?php echo config('domain_name'); ?></strong> and our partner providers are not liable
                        for trip disruptions beyond reasonable control — including weather delays, government orders,
                        civil disturbances, health alerts, acts of terrorism, or labor strikes. These are considered
                        uncontrollable risks associated with travel, and by booking through our platform, you accept
                        this possibility.</p>

                    <p>It is the responsibility of each traveler to ensure they hold valid documents before departure —
                        this includes passports, visas, health declarations, and entry permits as applicable.
                        <strong><?php echo config('domain_name'); ?></strong> is not accountable if you’re denied entry
                        or boarding due to incomplete or invalid documentation. We also recommend checking relevant
                        travel advisories from government and health bodies before you fly.</p>

                    <p>For added security, we strongly advise all travelers to purchase a reliable travel insurance
                        plan. This coverage may help you recover costs in the event of trip cancellations, emergencies,
                        lost items, or other unexpected disruptions during your journey.</p>

                    <p>By proceeding with any booking through <strong><?php echo config('domain_name'); ?></strong>, you
                        confirm that you understand and accept this disclaimer. You also agree to communicate these
                        terms to anyone traveling with you under the same booking.</p>
